Configuring MediaGoblin
========================

So!  You've got MediaGoblin up and running, but you need to adjust
some configuration parameters.  Well you've come to the right place!

MediaGoblin's config files
==========================

When configuring MediaGoblin, there are two files you might want to
make local modified versions of, and one extra file that might be
helpful to look at.  Let's examine these.

mediagoblin.ini

  tweak settings for MediaGoblin, you'll usually tweak them here.

paste.ini
