About the MediaGoblin Manual
============================

This is the user manual for MediaGoblin.  It covers how to set up and
configure MediaGoblin and the kind of information that someone running
MediaGoblin would need to know.

We have other documentation at:

* http://mediagoblin.org/join/ for general "join us" information
* http://wiki.mediagoblin.org/ for our contributor-focused wiki


Improving the MediaGobiin Manual
================================

There are a few ways---please pick whichever method is convenient for
you!

1. Write up a bug report in the bug tracker
2. Tell someone on IRC ``#mediagoblin`` on Freenode.
3. Write an email to the devel mailing list.

Information about the bugtracker, IRC and the mailing list is all on
the `join page`_.

Patches are the most helpful, but even feedback on what you think
could be improved and how to improve it is also helpful.
