If you're upgrading from a previous release, please read it

0.3.0 (not yet released)
========================

This release has one important change. You need to act when
upgrading from a previous version!

This release changes the database system from MongoDB to
SQL(alchemy). If you want to setup a fresh instance, just
follow the instructions in the deployment chapter. If on
the other hand you want to continue to use one instance,
read on.

To convert our data from MongoDB to SQL(alchemy), you need
to follow these steps:

1. Make sure your MongoDB is still running and has your
   data, it's needed for the conversion.

2. Configure the ``sql_engine`` URI in the config to represent
   your target database (see: :ref:`deploying-chapter`)

3. You need an empty database.

4. Then run the following command::

       bin/gmg [-cf mediagoblin_config.ini] convert_mongo_to_sql

5. Start your server and investigate.

6. That's it.
