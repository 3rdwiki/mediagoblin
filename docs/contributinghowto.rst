====================
 Contributing HOWTO
====================

We're super glad you want to contribute!

There are a variety of ways you can help us and become part of the
team.  We're not just looking for coders!  We're also looking for
documentation writers, users, testers, evangelists, painters, bakers,
candle-stick makers...

However, if you are a coder and you're looking to code, check out the
:ref:`hacking-howto`.

The rest of this chapter talks about different things we need your
help with.

**File bugs**

    Filing bugs is an important part of any project.  For more
    information on filing bugs, see :ref:`filing-bugs`.


**Translate GNU MediaGoblin**

    Knowing more than one language is an important skill.  If you are
    multi-lingual and are interested in translating GNU MediaGoblin,
    see :ref:`translating`.
